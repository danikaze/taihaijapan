# Taihai Japan

[Taihai Japan](https://taihaijapan.com) is a photography project by [@danikaze](https://twitter.com/danikaze) and this is the source gallery code of that site.

Feel free to fork it and customize it to create your own JavaScript based gallery ;)

This code is based on one of his [JavaScript boilerplates](https://github.com/danikaze/boilerplate-webpack-babel).
